N Queen
=========
The N Queen is the problem of placing N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens attack each other. 
which will be acheived by
1) Only one Queen in a row
2) Only one Queen in a column
3) Only one Queen Diagonaly

Complexity
===========
Space Complexity : O(n) -Single diamentional array
Time Complexity : Dynamic backtracking program - Hard

Solution:
=========
As there is only one Queen per row. Representing the chessboard grid as a single diamentional array, 
  => index Representing the row, value in that index will rpresent the column in which th queen is placed
  => finding which position to place the queen. pick [row,col] and check whether it is safe to place the queen there 
  => place the queen in the column when all there above conditions are satisied
Logic: placeQueen
======  1) iterate through the grid. where row is represented as index of the board and column is represented as values
        2) in a 2-diamentional array every row and col is checked[is it safe to place Queen there]
        3) if non of the column satisfies, program goes back a row and try placing in the next column in row-1
        4) step 3 is put in a backward loop till a Queen can be placed in a non conflict position in the above rows then program proceeds with step 2
        5) process is continued till the full grid is populated            

Logic: isSafe
======
    1.In same row (Single diamentional array will satisfy this condition
    2.In same column (traversel throu the array O(n) to find whether the particulatar column is occupied by another queen)
    3.Diagonal - within the board limit, 
                 a) all diagonal upper left side of [row,col] (eg: row-1 and column-1)
                 b) all diagonal upper right side of [row,col] (eg:row-1 and column+1)
