58. Length of Last Word

Given a string s consisting of some words separated by some number of spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.

A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "Hello World"
Output: 5
Explanation: The last word is "World" with length 5.
Example 2:

Input: s = "   fly me   to   the moon  "
Output: 4
Explanation: The last word is "moon" with length 4.
Example 3:

Input: s = "luffy is still joyboy"
Output: 6
Explanation: The last word is "joyboy" with length 6.
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 104
s consists of only English letters and spaces ' '.
There will be at least one word in s.
class Solution {
    /*Alg:
    1. read the string from the end. 
    2. assuming no special charachers
    3. ignore first spaces, count only the characters till the next space
    4. O(n) if the full string is a single word
    
    Test cases
    "    "
    ""
    "   fly me   to   the moon  "
    "Hello World"

        int i=n-1; 
         
        while(i>=0 && s[i]==' ') i--; // this will skip all the white spaces
        while(i>=0 && ((s[i]>='a' && s[i]<='z') || (s[i]>='A' && s[i]<='Z')))
